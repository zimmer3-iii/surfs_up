# Surfs_Up



## Overview of Project
	This project analyzes data from mulitple weather stations from the island of Oahu. 
	The main focus was to look at precipitation and temperature records to see if
	Oahu would be a good place to open a surf shop.


## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook, anaconda 1.9.0
The analysis was split into two parts:
- Precipitation: Code can be found in [climate_analysis](https://github.com/zimmer3-iii/surfs_up/blob/main/climate_analysis.ipynb)
- Temperature: Code can be found in [SurfsUp_Challenge](https://github.com/zimmer3-iii/surfs_up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb)
	
## Results

	The precipitation analysis focused on the data from the most active weather station 'USC00519281'. 
	Looking at the data from this weather station from 8-23-2016 to 8-23-2017,
	we can see that Oahu had an average daily rainfall of 0.177279 inches 
	and 75% of all the days were below 0.13000 inches.

	The temperature analysis was specificially requested for the months of June and December 
	to see if adding an icecream shop to the surf business would be a good idea.
	
	For June:
	- Min temperature was 64F
	- Max temperature was 85F
	- Only 25% of the days were colder than 73F
	For December:
	- Min temperatue was 56F
	- Max temperature was 83F
	- Only 25% of the days were colder then 69F


## Summary

### Surf Shop
	Since the average daily rainfall is less than a 0.25 inch, 
	it appears the weather precipitation is very favorable for opening a surf shop.

### Icecream Shop
	Having year round temperatues that would allow for an successful icecream shop can be hard to come by. 
	But with temperatues reaching into the 80Fs in December,
	the temperatue on Oahu appear to be favorable for opening the icecream shop.
